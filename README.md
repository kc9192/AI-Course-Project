# AI-Course-Project
A study in gradient descent algorithms

Understanding the behavior of the optimizers for loss and accuracy calculations on variety of datasets would be useful. 
When compiled using various models from transfer learning would help in understanding which optimizer helps us fit the model better.

This repository consists of project done for the AI course at Oakland University.
This repository consists of notebooks for the deep learning implementations and also the project proposal, report and presentation.
